# Zillow State Economics Data

In keeping with my recent focus on new visualization techniques, I thought it would be cool to due a state grid map.

To do this, I'll take state-level economic data from Zillow, which they provided through Kaggle, and plot in. 

Some people love them and some people hate them, but I think that state grid maps are a really interesting way to show state-level data through time, in a geographically representative way.
